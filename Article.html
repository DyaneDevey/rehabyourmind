        <p class="lead3"> The artist creates digital illustrations depicting iconic and day to day fashion moments – everything from a Gucci ad to a Chanel photoshoot to the newest it-sneak on the block. She includes witty captions and on-brand blurbs sketched next to the art. Claudia’s art is also extremely inclusive, depicting members of the LGBTQ+ community, people of color, and people of all ages. It’s really awesome checking out her account and seeing a grandma in Off White.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading8">How did you first get into art?</h2>
      <p class="lead3">When I was a kid I loved to draw, and when I had to choose what career path to take I decided to get my degree in Graphic Design. So, what I do now is a mix of both – digital illustration.</p>
      
      <h2 class="featurette-heading8">How did you first get inspiration to do fashion themed illustrations?</h2>
      <p class="lead3">I’ve always loved fashion and I love graphic design. I used to buy fashion magazines to get inspo for my graphic design projects. I would study fashion campaigns and loved the art direction behind photoshoots. I would get inspired in the color palettes, prints in the clothing, the details behind each editorial. So, I always appreciated fashion but never thought I could mix both worlds.

        About a year ago, I wanted to create a “side project” where I could get my mind off my busy days. I was looking at my IG when a Gucci campaign popped-up with memes. I thought to myself, I could do that with illustrations. I made a couple, created my profile, and when I saw peoples positive reaction towards my work, I knew I had something good in the making.</p>     

      <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Which designers are your most favorite to depict?</h2>
      <p class="lead3">Alessandro Michele, Karl Lagerfeld, and Maria Grazia Chiuri.</p>

			<br>
      <h2 class="featurette-heading8">How do you come up with your unique phrases/words next to the illustrations?
      </h2>
      <p class="lead3">I’ve always liked to make projects that have some sort of humor in them. I believe that when you can make someone smile or laugh you can make someone feel identified, or make a deeper connection.

        The illustrations that I make are of things that I really like. Most are thoughts that pop-up when I’m making an illustration, my initial reaction when observing a fashion editorial, the perfect handbag, or the much needed shoes I would love to own but can’t afford.
        
        I also love a good meme, so when I see one that I can adapt or apply to my illustrations, I’ll use it as well.
        
        </p>     

        <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Big designers like Gucci have done very Internet-inspired campaigns (with memes, etc). What brand or designer would you love to collab with on an ad campaign featuring your art?
        </h2>
        <p class="lead3">My ULTIMATE dream is to work with Gucci. I love how their brand collaborates with different artists and graphic designers. I also love how they can play with humor, and people can actually relate to it.

          In everything they d0 – if its the clothing, the runway, the invites to the fashion shows, the editorials you can see in magazines, or the small films behind each campaign – there is a strong presence of art direction, a beautiful aesthetic, and it can truly be a piece of art.
          
          </p>     
  
          <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Designer that speaks to you the most artistically?
          </h2>
          <p class="lead3">Alessandro Michele and Karl Lagerfeld. </p>     
    
          <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Why do you want to make fashion more “fun,” as you’ve said?</h2>
          <p class="lead3">I just think that when it comes to fashion, there are a lot of stereotypes. In terms of what I’m creating, I wanted the approach to be fun and just something that most can identify with. Even if your not the biggest “fashionista” out there.</p>     
    
          <h2 class="featurette-heading8">What do you think your art uniquely contributes to the fashion world?</h2>
          <p class="lead3">I think @vibesbyclaudia has become in a way a fashion archive, a place where you can find fashion trends and inspiration with a unique presentation, in this case illustrations. A place where you can see fashion in a fun, friendly manner.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Artist you’d love to work with and why?

        </h2>
          <p class="lead3">I love Coco Capitán. I would love to make my digital illustrations and combine her awesome handwriting for the phrases. I love her poems. She is also a photographer and has combined two world, like me, which I really admire. When I read her story, it inspired me to make personal projects like what I am doing now.

          </p>   


          <h2 class="featurette-heading8">If you could have an art show with all of your illustrations – dream location?

          </h2>
            <p class="lead3">I would love it to be either in my hometown in Guatemala, or Florence, Italy because if I’m dreaming big I might as well imagine myself collaborating with my fave brand at the Gucci Headquarters, drinking wine and eating pizza with my future bff Alessandro Michele.
