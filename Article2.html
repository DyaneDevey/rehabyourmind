      <h2 class="featurette-heading8">How did you first get into art?</h2>
      <p class="lead">When I was a kid I loved to draw, and when I had to choose what career path to take I decided to
        get my degree in Graphic Design. So, what I do now is a mix of both – digital illustration.</p>

      <h2 class="featurette-heading8">How did you first get inspiration to do fashion themed illustrations?</h2>
      <p class="lead">I’ve always loved fashion and I love graphic design. I used to buy fashion magazines to get inspo
        for my graphic design projects. I would study fashion campaigns and loved the art direction behind photoshoots.
        I would get inspired in the color palettes, prints in the clothing, the details behind each editorial. So, I
        always appreciated fashion but never thought I could mix both worlds.

        About a year ago, I wanted to create a “side project” where I could get my mind off my busy days. I was looking
        at my IG when a Gucci campaign popped-up with memes. I thought to myself, I could do that with illustrations. I
        made a couple, created my profile, and when I saw peoples positive reaction towards my work, I knew I had
        something good in the making.</p>

    </div>





    <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Which designers are your most favorite to depict?</h2>
    <p class="lead">Alessandro Michele, Karl Lagerfeld, and Maria Grazia Chiuri.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading8">How do you come up with your unique phrases/words next to the illustrations?
    </h2>
    <p class="lead">I’ve always liked to make projects that have some sort of humor in them. I believe that when you can
      make someone smile or laugh you can make someone feel identified, or make a deeper connection.

      The illustrations that I make are of things that I really like. Most are thoughts that pop-up when I’m making an
      illustration, my initial reaction when observing a fashion editorial, the perfect handbag, or the much needed
      shoes I would love to own but can’t afford.

      I also love a good meme, so when I see one that I can adapt or apply to my illustrations, I’ll use it as well.

    <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Big designers like Gucci have done very Internet-inspired campaigns (with memes,
      etc). What brand or designer would you love to collab with on an ad campaign featuring your art?
    </h2>
    <p class="lead">My ULTIMATE dream is to work with Gucci. I love how their brand collaborates with different artists
      and graphic designers. I also love how they can play with humor, and people can actually relate to it.

      In everything they d0 – if its the clothing, the runway, the invites to the fashion shows, the editorials you can
      see in magazines, or the small films behind each campaign – there is a strong presence of art direction, a
      beautiful aesthetic, and it can truly be a piece of art.

    </p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Designer that speaks to you the most artistically?
    </h2>
    <p class="lead">Alessandro Michele and Karl Lagerfeld. </p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Why do you want to make fashion more “fun,” as you’ve said?</h2>
    <p class="lead">I just think that when it comes to fashion, there are a lot of stereotypes. In terms of what I’m
      creating, I wanted the approach to be fun and just something that most can identify with. Even if your not the
      biggest “fashionista” out there.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading8">What do you think your art uniquely contributes to the fashion world?</h2>
    <p class="lead">I think @vibesbyclaudia has become in a way a fashion archive, a place where you can find fashion
      trends and inspiration with a unique presentation, in this case illustrations. A place where you can see fashion
      in a fun, friendly manner.</p>

    <h2 class="featurette-heading8">Artist you’d love to work with and why?

    </h2>
    <p class="lead">I love Coco Capitán. I would love to make my digital illustrations and combine her awesome
      handwriting for the phrases. I love her poems. She is also a photographer and has combined two world, like me,
      which I really admire. When I read her story, it inspired me to make personal projects like what I am doing now.

    </p>


    <h2 class="featurette-heading8">If you could have an art show with all of your illustrations – dream location?

    </h2>
    <p class="lead">I would love it to be either in my hometown in Guatemala, or Florence, Italy because if I’m dreaming
      big I might as well imagine myself collaborating with my fave brand at the Gucci Headquarters, drinking wine and
      eating pizza with my future bff Alessandro Michele.
